next test run:
increase version

current tasks:
- mapModifier: poison   
    - create mapModifier
        - give every enemy in area "poison tile immunity"
        - give random amount ability poison tiles
            - closer to center more likely to have ability
            - should have some visualization
    - create area boss: poison plant
        - can not be damaged
        - all damage also % based
        - will shrink/loose hp when using poison abilities
        - first ability
            - shoot poison area to player position (like fireCircle)
                - poison area slowly moves around
            - only shoots when close enough to area boss
        - second ability
            - when player stands still for x amount
                - shoot poison beam
                    - slow charge up
                    - will shoot once charge up full or when player moves again
                        - stronger dependant on charge up but uses more poison
                    - can slowly turn, will fire for some amount of time
                    - does a lot of damage
        - third ability
            - when player very close
            - melee aoe damage poison area, which grows for some time than disappers


- be able to cleanse bad part of curses
- damagemeter/combatlog for curses?
- think about changing alot of type casts as they are not required
    - "ability as AbilitySomething" could be replaced by giving the type to function property directly
    - type | undefined change to ?

next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - mapModifier:
        - "poison tiles" change walked over tiles to poison tiles which do % damage over time?
            - destroys ice tiles
            - ability for all enemies in this area, or the closer to the middle the more enemies have the ability
            - area boss ideas:
                - poison plant
                - plant shrinks the more poison it spreads
                - regenerates poison over time
                - can not be damaged
                - can not move? maybe blink?
                - defeated if survided long enough 
                - player has to trigger poison usage to shrink it faster than it can regenerate
        - wind modifier
            - pushes characters, maybe objects?, to a side
        - rainy weather

    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - becomes rainy
                - 
            - becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
