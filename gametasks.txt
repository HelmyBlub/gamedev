text test run: Tamer, Builder, Sniper, All

current tasks:
- problem: to many abilties. no longer visible with "tab"/info key. Improve it
    - redesign code for it
    - it is not visualized what statsUI is painted. Put in an heading
    - limit number of displayed abilities
        - only display for one character class
        - put in button to change which class is displayed
        - put in button to switch if e.g. class building or player is displayed
    - dev steps:
        - new type: StatsUI
            - text in a rect
        - new type: StatsUisContainer
            - headingText, e.g. Character/PastCharacter/ClassBuilding...
            - StatsUIs

        - new game.UI.currentStatsUI
            - "StatsUisContainer[i]"
                -i => select one of: character/classBuilding/pastCharacter/gameRules/highscores
            - need select button for which to display

- think about next bigger feature 
    - ideas
        - some easier permanent progression. like more baseHP, more baseSpeed gain for each run

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
