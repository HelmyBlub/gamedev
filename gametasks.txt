Today tasks:

future tasks:
- create backend, e.g. with WebSocketNode
- two player different "connections" still one computer

thoughts:
    Multiplayer:
    - backend for online multiplayer
    - TCP, websocket
        -https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node

    - UDP browser? probably still no option



game ideas:
- want to make a simple web browser game
- want to try online/multiplayer play 
- somehow should be randomized content for much replayability
    - rogue like
