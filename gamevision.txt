broad game goal:
- rogue like multiplayer
- want to make a simple web browser game
- want to try online/multiplayer play 
- somehow should be randomized content for much replayability

game ideas:
- a lot of different "classes" to choose from
    - melee
        - big slow weapon, warrior
        - fast, rogue
    - caster
        - either level just one "explosion" spell for ever, or many spells
- gathering some ressources for a upgrade system
- multiplayer ideas:
    - parallel mind: multiple players same character
- middle base area ideas:
    - "died" characters become towns people
        - name your character at the start of a run
        - characters rember their "death" reason and say a line like "i used to be an adventurer like you, but <death reason>"
    - wood to build buildings, only possible before run starts
        - buildings for permanent buffs
            - weapon & armor building
