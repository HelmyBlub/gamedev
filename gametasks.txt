next test run: 
increase version

current tasks:        
- think about Tower builder scalling?
    - tower builder new upgrade +5% tower damage
- new test run: short king kill, god kill


next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - becomes rainy
                - 
            - becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
