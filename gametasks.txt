next test run: 
increase version

current tasks:     
- new class spellmaker
    - next steps?
        - when a tool is doing damage it levels up and makes the ability more mana efficient and damage multiply
            - continue: mana factor need to be calculated and used
            - toolChain needs to be filled correctly to determine which tool gets damage contribution
            - display tool level
        - balance stuff:
            - lightning too strong
            - other to weak?
        - improve UX
            - put tool options to paintUI and paintAbove normal ability buttons
                - problems:
                    - code for network play can not support this
                        - only sends abilityIndex and mouse position
                        - would need ability + ability specific information
                        - if i want to paint based on canvas size i am client dependant which does no work mith multiplayer code
                - match size
            - display mana cost for spell in creation
            - visualize when in spellmake stage
        - spelltype: fix charge, custom charge, instant, stationary custom charge
        - check bosses and other stuff
    - generall gameplay
        - defeating bosses gives new tool selection
        - should be able to have two spells
        - somehow able to create new spells while playing
            - maybe character invisible to normal enemies when making spells?

    - remember: relative mouse position not used for holding mouse button down
    - hope explosion spell possible in the end: gets more expensive but explosion can get bigger and bigger
        - charge type spell
- speedrun my game
    - kill god as fast as possible
        - real Time: <12:07 (builder + ball)
        - real time: <18:20 (builder + tamer)
        - to squishy (builder + sniper)
    - kill hard mode god as fast as possible:
        - strategy:
            - ball to end for money and upgrade buildings
            - play sniper and become king
                - defeat king for legendary, use ball + legendary to defeat all kings to level up
            - sniper legendary
                - level up max (~40min skillpoints 25 and level 430)
                    - still to weak and very laggy build
- bug: short king replay failed. why?
    - very first pet movement of past characters seems correct, second broken


next feature ideas:
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extend existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
        - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
            - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
        - spellmaker
            - be able to make spells by drawing
    - base building
        - more options to spend money to build up map center city
    - money gambling casino
    - make random caves/dungeon to enter
        - try out different generation stategies
        - minigames?
