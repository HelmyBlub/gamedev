current tasks:
- check fire line damage after code invterval fix
- new class:
    - ball abiltities for enemies
        - currently boss does nothing
        - bug: teleporting boss creates long fire lines
    - visualize class somehow

- having multiple ball abilities? does not work
- performance spikes when rolling fast with many enemies?
    - make enemies teleport back instead of runback?
- multiplayer bug: leashes on game over
- multiplayer: do not visulaize other pets happines?

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
