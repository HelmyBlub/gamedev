current tasks:
- new test runs
    - check tamer run -> make him win bossfight
        - Bug: tamer run do not replay correctly again
            - does not happen always
            - download last stream(#152), compare runs to maybe find reason
                - real run 33:52
                - replay 46:53
                    - slow diverges, unsure if it starts with game starts diverged or takes a second
                        - unsuer after 3 sec. definetly diverged after gametime of 6+ seconds
                    - random number generator seems correctly (unsure if this makes sense)
                        - same choice for first boss upgrades
            - reproduce steps:
                1. have a state with a lot of past tamers 
                2. reload browser
                3. move a bit
                4. restart
                5. run right and choose tamer class on the endboss sign
                6. feed one pet until fat and player character has to pull him
                7. run right until dead while pulling fat pet
            - same steps but without steps 3&4
                - problem did not occure
            - random seed seem to be correct
            - thoughts:
                - do i use some reference instead of a value somewhere?
                - only affects tamer, so it should hae something todo with class choice?
    - get a end boss defeating snipe run
- balancing
    - defeat each endboss character type once
        - sniper
            - defeat sniper boss
        - tamer
            - sniper: can outrun slow of boss pet?
            - tamer: can keep distance from boss pets?
        - one with all
            - defeat boss with all
        - builder
