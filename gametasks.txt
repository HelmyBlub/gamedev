next test run:
increase version

current tasks:
- next map modifier:
    - ice modifier
        - next: maze generation work in progress. 
            - solve maze backwards to better know where to place next tree
                - continue in function "solveMazeBackwards"
            - maze placing blocking tiles not creating solveable mazes
                - resturcture code 
                - solve maze based on goal tile backwards
                    - only backwards for goal tile
                - check is escapeable&solveable
                    - if not -> put tile on loop which is not part of goal reaching loop
        - add areaboss snowman
            - snowman has no health bar.
            - snowman dies by "sliding over"
            - create algorithm to create sliding maze?
                - maze middle need to be reached. Tile where snowman stands.
                    - if reached, than the snowman will die.  Middle tiles will turn back to grass.
                - middle should only be reachable through certain path
                - set size: by tiles
                - all tiles in maze size will become ice tiles
                - certain tiles will be changed to blocking tiles to reach middle
                    - should not be able to get stuck, so every path needs to be able to reach middle or get out
                - dev steps ideas:
                    - make algorithm which searches a solutions and visualizes it
                        - search reachable position from start point
                            - search escapeable positions from reachable points
                        - usefull for debugging
                        - to know if solution exists
                        - might help to better understand how to generate later    
                    - algorithm do generate blocking tiles for maze
        - remove enemies on tiles changed to blocking tiles        
        - add new curse ice
            - change tiles to ice tiles around player
        - check ice curse on king.
- check: cloud machine boss on higher level to many explosions?
- be able to cleanse bad part of curses
- bug: tower builder combatlog
    - single target damage missing
    - tower line missing

next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
            - some off time between streams. Good for getting ideas
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it
                - 
            - more to explore on map, currently most is the same
                - manipulate certain part of map with modifier
                    - ice modifier
                        - ice tile patches which makes enemies and players "slide"
                        - more difficult movement
                        - player curse effect?
                            - negative: nearby tiles become ice tiles
                            - positive: permanent ice aura around player?
                        - boss idea:
                            - snow man
                                - puzzle boss?
                                - you have to find a way to slide to him
                                - protected by some barrier from damage, get close to him to remove
                    - wind modifier
                        - pushes characters, maybe objects?, to a side
                    - rainy weather

                    - can have a boss enemy in the middle
                    - be able to modify enemies in this area
                    - be able to spawn different enemies
                    - be able to change map tile textures
                    - what does the player gain doing it?

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - north: becomes snowy (each new run? each time king killed?)
                - icy ground, more difficult to move
            - east: becomes rainy
                - 
            - west: becomes dark
                - more difficult to see, fog of war. Blocking tiles block view
            - south: becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
