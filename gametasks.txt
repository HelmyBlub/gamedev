current tasks:
- bug: class building burrowed text wrong if multiple legendary on one king

- feature: visualize king stats when neart king sign and "tab" for more info pressed
- check bug?: replay -> overtake -> past character from replay -> intended?
- think about next bigger feature 
    - ideas
        - some easier permanent progression. like more baseHP, more baseSpeed gain for each run

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
