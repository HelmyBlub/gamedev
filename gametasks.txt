next technical tasks or bugs:
- use javascript modules

next functional tasks:
- infinite map
    - map tiles:
        - grass
        - stone (blocking)
        - tree (blooking but destroyable)
    - procedural map generation
- add more variety of upgrades

future technical tasks:
- host game for others to join
    - multiplayer connection delay is too bad, try other options?
- think: is automated testing already usefull?
- https/ssl websocket
    - https://www.nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/, where goes the config?

future tasks:
    - multiplayer 
        - gamesync
            - try with different client delays
            - need real users to compare how it behaves
    - every one controlls their own character
        - currently has to wait on gamerestart, could make it to be in on join

    - make the game look descent as soon as it fun
    - deployment pipeline to a real server


game ideas:
- infinite map, the further from the middle the stronger the enemies
    - different directions from the center -> different types of enemies
    - bosses after certain amount of distance of center -> bosses give better rewards but challenging
    - map middle is safe area, could be a base area

- want to make a simple web browser game
- want to try online/multiplayer play 
- somehow should be randomized content for much replayability
    - rogue like
- a lot of different "classes" to choose from
    - melee
        - big slow weapon, warrior
        - fast, rogue
    - range
        - gun, bow
    - caster
        - either level just one "explosion" spell for ever, or many spells
    - tamer
        - tame enemies
        - revive dead enemies
- some upgrade system to be stronger for each new run, or for different start options
- gathering some ressources for a upgrade system
