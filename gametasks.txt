new test runs required: builder

current tasks:
- class Buildings and legendary:
    - dev steps:
        - Visualize which kings has burrowed legendary
        - "Press interact key", what is the interact key?
            - make drawTextWithKey function?

- use tab key to visualise statsUi for every thing and don't make it overlapp
- check bug?: replay -> overtake -> past character from replay -> intended?
- rename endboss to king in code ?
