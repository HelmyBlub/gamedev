current tasks:
- take past characters abilities
    - middle has some kind of camp:
        - fire in the middle, character "sitting" around on a log
    - see what they died from, their level, their abilities

- visualization of Next End Bosses on start area
    - sign which says: "<type> endboss in 20k distance"

- replay/record works with ability takeover and pastCharacters
- refactoring
- balancing
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
