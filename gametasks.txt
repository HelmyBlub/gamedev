current tasks:
- first permanent progression idea:
    - dev steps:
        - remove todo in file mapObjectClassBuilding method mapObjectPlaceClassBuilding
        - on end boss(who has a class) defeat abilties need to be put to class building
            - create new level 1 abilities for these which aretradeable?
                - add "legendary" status
                - linking to building
        - player can burrow abilities
        - abilities need to be put back on restart, loss. Dont put back on end boss defeat
            - past character does not have abilities which where burrowed
        - change scalling of burrowed abilities
            - ...
        - save in localStorage
    - make class building appear once a class endboss has been beaten or when endboss with a class has been beaten?
        - have x places like the logs where buildings can be.
    - "legendary class", can level indefinetly(but slower) over multiple runs (but boss skillpoints are limited to boss counter)
        - unlocking legendary "snipe": 
            - beat sniper endboss
                - give sniper weapon the lore "former weapon of king of the <celestialDirection>"
            - with new character take up "legendary class" from class building. Counts as class choose choice
                - but can take up multiple legendary classes at once
        - weapon returns to class building after each run unless character becomes new endboss
            - character becomes classless pastCharacter
            - if character with legendary sniper becomes endboss, "legendary snipe" not available in "smith building" until end boss defeated
                - "legendary sniper" becomes stronger somehow

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
