next test run: musician
increase version

current tasks:
- fix multiplayer 
    - chunk enemy ids different
        - noticed because of comabatlog ids don't match
        - but total number of ids matches
        - found out:    
            - chunk generation order different in clients
            - did not find any reason for it yet
            - "createMissingChunk" printing out chunkX and chunkY resulted in different orders for my two client
            - analysed "generateMissingChunks" but did not notice anything yet
- play test myself
- bug: short king recording not always resulting in working replay
- think about one more curse
- be able to cleanse bad part of curses

next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
            - some off time between streams. Good for getting ideas
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it
            - more to explore on map, currently most is the same
                - manipulate certain part of map with modifier
                    - wind modifier
                        - pushes characters, maybe objects?, to a side
                    - rainy weather

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - becomes rainy
                - 
            - becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
