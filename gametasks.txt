ideas for next tasks:

        - build your character at the start?
            - random at the start?


technical tasks or bugs:
    - character.size changed to width and height. but hit calculation still only uses width
    - find uses of "any" type and try to remove
    - upgrade versions
    - use same code files for backend and frontend
        - understand require vs import in backend vs frontend
    - Perforamnce bug: pulling many enemies far away from spawn and than outranging them, they will move back to their own spawn and create a lot of lag
    - mutlipalyer:
        - automated inputs for multiple clients

future functional tasks:
    - if an enemy is aggroed in an inactive chunk, it should be active
    - map tiles:
        - destroyable tiles
            - destroy trees to gather wood
    - improve enemies?
        - sprites/ images

        - unity example https://gamedevacademy.org/procedural-2d-maps-unity-tutorial/
    - multiplayer 
        - gamesync
            - need real users to compare how it behaves
    - every one controlls their own character
        - currently has to wait on gamerestart, could make it to be in on join

    - make the game look descent as soon as it fun
    - deployment pipeline to a real server
    - projectiles hitting same enemy every tick
    - enemy animation, currenlty all move in sync
    - if enemy hp low than color changes or fill amount changes?

future technical tasks:
- multiplayer test speedup should also work
- Bug: infinte pathing problem if enemy surounded by blocking tiles, currently only solved thorugh a max counter
- multiplayer connection delay with localtunnel is too bad, try other options?
- https/ssl websocket
    - https://www.nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/, where goes the config?
