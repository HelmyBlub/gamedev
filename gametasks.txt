next test run:
increase version

current tasks:
- be able to cleanse bad part of curses
    - dev steps:
        - think about how to create boss?
            - copy player. once for each curse. Each copy only has one curse. Scale hp up
    - on 80_000 distance make a new closed of area with some fountain
    - fountain is an interactable which asks: clean curses from legendary?
    - when started for each curse currently on player legendary create a more difficult challenge
        - ideas:
            - poison curse -> change tiles to poison tiles in area
            - darkness -> limit view distance, create clones
            - ice curse -> change tiles to ice tiles in area
            - lightning -> lightning strikes while fighting
            - boss ideas: one boss enemy per curse
                - each boss enemy has one curse
                - fight is one when all are dead
    - cleansed legendaries curse will not increase until broken
        - staying in curse ground effect for to long will remove the cleansed effect
    - fountain image

- king hp bar not correctly placed when zoomed out or in
- check: king and god area created on first play on page load? something looked of with the code
- check: retry on king and god. Code makes it look like it should not work since map area bosses exist
- check: touch controls for cleanse fountain

- damagemeter/combatlog for curses?
- achievements for curses? 
- money for curse related stuff?

next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - becomes rainy
                - 
            - becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
