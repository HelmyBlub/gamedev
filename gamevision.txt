broad game goal:
- rogue like multiplayer
- want to make a simple web browser game
- want to try online/multiplayer play 
- somehow should be randomized content for much replayability

game ideas:
- infinite map, the further from the middle the stronger the enemies
    - different directions from the center -> different types of enemies
    - bosses after cedrtain amount of distance of center -> bosses give better rewards but challenging
    - map middle is safe area, could be a base area

- a lot of different "classes" to choose from
    - melee
        - big slow weapon, warrior
        - fast, rogue
    - range
        - gun, bow
    - caster
        - either level just one "explosion" spell for ever, or many spells
    - tamer
        - tame enemies
        - revive dead enemies
- some upgrade system to be stronger for each new run, or for different start options
- gathering some ressources for a upgrade system
- multiplayer ideas:
    - parallel mind: multiple players same character
- middle base area ideas:
    - "died" characters become towns people
        - name your character at the start of a run
        - characters rember their "death" reason and say a line like "i used to be an adventurer like you, but <death reason>"
    - wood to build buildings, only possible before run starts
        - buildings for permanent buffs
            - weapon & armor building
