next test run: tamer, ball
increase version

current tasks:
- multiplayer
    - player duplication issues
        - somehow i got my character two times (stream 254)
        - use my own streams to find out what happened?
        - thoughts:
            - when server restarts it losese client ids.
            - but game state still has players with client ids
            - on reconect, server gives a client id, by chance, this id might exists still in players
            - find out order of action to reproduce
                - player 1 joins multiplayer
                - player 2 joins multiplayer
                - server restarts
                - player 2 rejoins first (can be force by disconnecting with player 1)
                - player 1 reconnects
                - restart and there are 3 player characters
    - sync issue
        - false positive:
            - some id issues, but should no result in problems
            - some ordering of attribute, but should not result in problems
                - is it maybe of json parse and stringify don't order always in the same way?
    - ping issue:
        - somehow when connecting with "bad" ping it will not correct itself to a better value
        - could not reproduce
- change: ability "capped" state instead of part of gifted


next feature ideas:
- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
