next test run: 
increase version

current tasks:     
- new class spellmaker
    - change: player HP bar should be painted last, or after wizard hat accessoire
    - check: king spellmaker with expesive spells but player had high mana reduce
    - next steps
        - images:
            - icons for:
                - tools
                    - add
                    - reset
                    - delete
                    - stage
                    - etc...

        - improve UX
            - improve tool texts
        - spelltype: fix charge, custom charge, instant, stationary custom charge
        - prevent: player deleting all spells before king defeated results in king without any spell
        - tool orbiter:
            - currently only handles to work for character as orbit target. Either make i the only option with explanation or work with other things
            - if orbit target no longer exists, don't search each tick in all entities, bad for performance
    - remember: relative mouse position not used for holding mouse button down
    - hope explosion spell possible in the end: gets more expensive but explosion can get bigger and bigger
        - charge type spell
    - achievements
- speedrun my game
    - kill god as fast as possible
        - real Time: <12:07 (builder + ball)
        - real time: <18:20 (builder + tamer)
        - to squishy (builder + sniper)
    - kill hard mode god as fast as possible:
        - strategy:
            - ball to end for money and upgrade buildings
            - play sniper and become king
                - defeat king for legendary, use ball + legendary to defeat all kings to level up
            - sniper legendary
                - level up max (~40min skillpoints 25 and level 430)
                    - still to weak and very laggy build
- bug: short king replay failed. why?
    - very first pet movement of past characters seems correct, second broken


next feature ideas:
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extend existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
        - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
            - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
        - spellmaker
            - be able to make spells by drawing
    - base building
        - more options to spend money to build up map center city
    - money gambling casino
    - make random caves/dungeon to enter
        - try out different generation stategies
        - minigames?
