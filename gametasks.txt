next functional tasks:
- enemy pathing, find to player
    - too slow, improvment ideas
        - remeber calculated pathes for other enemies for same tick
- map tiles:
    - destroyable tiles
- some balancing, currenlty player gets overwhelming strong, enemies can not keep up
    - leveling up requires more xp each level
    - shootspeed upgrade change to linear instead of exponetial (perfromance lmit will not be reached as fast)
    - maybe change to enemies get stronger the further away from middle the player is

next technical tasks or bugs:
- bug: on page reload somethime there is 2second lag until next page reload
- upgrade versions
- use same code files for backend and frontend
    - understand require vs import in backend vs frontend
- holding key down creates a lot of keyDown events, always sending over network although nothing changed

future functional tasks:
    - procedural map generation
        - add more map features for orientation like a path
        - unity example https://gamedevacademy.org/procedural-2d-maps-unity-tutorial/
    - multiplayer 
        - gamesync
            - try with different client delays
            - need real users to compare how it behaves
    - every one controlls their own character
        - currently has to wait on gamerestart, could make it to be in on join

    - make the game look descent as soon as it fun
    - deployment pipeline to a real server
    - projectiles hitting same enemy every tick

future technical tasks:
- multiplayer connection delay with localtunnel is too bad, try other options?
- think: is automated testing already usefull?
- https/ssl websocket
    - https://www.nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/, where goes the config?
