new test runs required: 

current tasks:
- use tab key to visualise statsUi for every thing and don't make it overlapp
- check bug?: replay -> overtake -> past character from replay -> intended?
- feature: visualize king stats when neart king sign and "tab" for more info pressed
- rename endboss to king in code ?

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
