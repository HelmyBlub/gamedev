new test runs required: builder

current tasks:
- class Buildings and legendary:
    - dev steps:
        - change scalling of burrowed abilities
            - add limit for pets
            - somehow visualize it. Visualize which kings has burrowed legendary

- "paintCharacterStatsUI" fix UI text based on class and legendary
- check bug?: replay -> overtake -> past character from replay -> intended?
- rename endboss to king in code ?

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
