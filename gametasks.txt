next test run:
increase version

current tasks:
- be able to cleanse bad part of curses
    - check mulitplayer
        - start conditions fountain use and what for multiplayer
        - other
    
- rename cheats as they are no longer correctly named: low hp, close, put together with others

- king hp bar not correctly placed when zoomed out or in
    - same for fountain boss
- check: king and god area created on first play on page load? something looked of with the code
- check: retry on king and god. Code makes it look like it should not work since map area bosses exist
- check: touch controls for cleanse fountain

- damagemeter/combatlog for curses?
- achievements for curses? 
- money for curse related stuff?
- area boss spider resistant to damage in darkness (always dies offscreen which might be confusing) 

next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - becomes rainy
                - 
            - becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system
