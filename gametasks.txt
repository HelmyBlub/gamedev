next test run: 
increase version

current tasks:     
- new class spellmaker
    - tool orbiter:
        - on spellmake mode:
            - when click, determine closest object to be the orbiting object
                - visualize orbit and orbit center
                    - orbit visualization is based on click position, but it should center somehow
                        - turrets have center, fireLine does not, how to handle?
                - check if function "getClosestCenter" required for orbiter to work
            - automatically find closest other object to be the center orbitet around
            - allow orbit offset
            - can drag to change center
            - make orbit speed constant, not modifyable
        - 
    - spelltype: fix charge, custom charge, instant, stationary custom charge
    - prevent: player deleting all spells before king defeated results in king without any spell
    - remember: relative mouse position not used for holding mouse button down
    - hope explosion spell possible in the end: gets more expensive but explosion can get bigger and bigger
        - charge type spell
    - achievements
    - check "playerGlobalAlphaMultiplier" to be used in spellmaker
    - check: touch controlls for spellmake mode
- moreInfo with hover text should have (i) indicator, so player knows there is more info
- speedrun my game
    - kill god as fast as possible
        - real Time: <12:07 (builder + ball)
        - real time: <18:20 (builder + tamer)
        - to squishy (builder + sniper)
    - kill hard mode god as fast as possible:
        - strategy:
            - ball to end for money and upgrade buildings
            - play sniper and become king
                - defeat king for legendary, use ball + legendary to defeat all kings to level up
            - sniper legendary
                - level up max (~40min skillpoints 25 and level 430)
                    - still to weak and very laggy build
- bug: short king replay failed. why?
    - very first pet movement of past characters seems correct, second broken


next feature ideas:
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extend existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
        - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
            - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
        - spellmaker
            - be able to make spells by drawing
    - base building
        - more options to spend money to build up map center city
    - money gambling casino
    - make random caves/dungeon to enter
        - try out different generation stategies
