current tasks:
- new class:
    - visualize class somehow
        - lightning ball
            - when in lightning form "small" blue ball with lightning effect for the rest of the dmg radius
            - when having ability: small lightning ball in hand

- check fire line damage after code invterval fix
- having multiple ball abilities? does not work
- performance spikes when rolling fast with many enemies?
    - make enemies teleport back instead of runback?
- multiplayer bug: leashes on game over
