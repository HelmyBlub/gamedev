next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
            - some off time between streams. Good for getting ideas
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it
                - 
            - more to explore on map, currently most is the same
                - manipulate certain part of map with modifier
                    - dark modifier

                        - blocking tiles block vision
                        - boss in the middle is "dark" copy of all players
                        - if boss is defeated, dark modifier dissapears
                            - and player gets "dark" modifier

                        - damages player and enemie
                    - rainy weather

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - north: becomes snowy (each new run? each time king killed?)
                - icy ground, more difficult to move
            - east: becomes rainy
                - 
            - west: becomes dark
                - more difficult to see, fog of war. Blocking tiles block view
            - south: becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
