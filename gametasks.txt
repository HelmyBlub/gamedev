current tasks:
- new class:
    - lightning ball upgrade(only one tier upgrade, dependand on bounce ball upgrade): ->
        - next use of lightning ball empowered by max bounces of last bounce ball

    - main problem: tankiness of "melee" type of ball character
        - hp leach of lightning ball also increases maxHp?
    - upgrade ideas:    
        -ball has alot of synergie upgrades?
            - lightning strikes upgrade: ->
                - while lightning strikes buff is active in bounce ball, you take half damage
    - impl:
        - ability lightning ball
            - upgrades:
                - random bonus stat upgrade: +maxSpeed, -rechargeTime, +charges
                - lightning leach
                    - follow up upgrade
                        - increases max hp temporarily
                - lightningStrikes + hp leach -> upgrade lightningStrikes HP leach synergy
                - lightning buff:
                    - after using lightning ball, next bounce ball is empowered
                - lightning debuff
                    - enemy takes more damage, speed up bounce ball, stackable
        - bounce ball
            - think about more "interesting" upgrades
                - temporary buff enemies hit burn, runs for some time after bounce ball finishes
                - random bonus stat upgrade: +bounceSpeed,+angle,+speedLoss,+maxSpeed, -rechargeTime, +charges
                - debuff
                    - enemy takes more damage, colldown reduce for lightning ball

- enemy on death put back to spawn position. So they tick in own chunk
- having multiple ball abilities? does not work

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
