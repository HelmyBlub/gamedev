next test run: sniper, builder, musician
increase version

current tasks:
- map modifier
    - darkness
        - if player defeats areaBoss -> spawn abilityObject "curse: Darkness"
            - new file curse
            - create type curse
                - type
                - level
            - create type curseDarkness
            - add character.curses
                - object []:Curse 
            - abilityObjectCurseDarkness should apply curseDarkness
            - add to game ticks
            - implement curseDarkness
                - spawn dark Clone
                - after x sec -> turn clone to enemy

            - abilityObject "curse: Darkness"
                - circle area, if player stands in it, player will get cursed
                - the longer the player stands in area, the more the curse will grow
                - delay, when boss killed, take a second for players to be able to run out of curse area
            - should give some upside and some downside effects
                - upside: "shadow clones" gains player duplicate
                    - stronger curse => multiple "shadow clones"
                - downside idea: shadow clones turn to enemy after time
                - downside idea: randomly vision limit appears for some time
                    - stronger curse => more often, longer exists, reduce vision range more
        - save in permanent storage
        - check same wall not generated multiple times
            - backwards raycast required?
            - angle limits need to update correctly
            - some very precise wall can be missed by raycast?



- musician: play note when placed?
    - problem: hard to know how it sounds when you have to wait on longer music sheets
- musician: be able to place notes 1/8 & 1/16 allways


next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
            - some off time between streams. Good for getting ideas
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it
                - 
            - more to explore on map, currently most is the same
                - manipulate certain part of map with modifier
                    - dark modifier
                        - "fog of war". Player can only see whats in line of sight
                        - blocking tiles block vision
                        - boss in the middle is "dark" copy of all players
                        - if boss is defeated, dark modifier dissapears
                            - and player gets "dark" modifier
                    - ice modifier
                        - ice tile patches which makes enemies and players "slide"
                        - more difficult movement
                    - wind modifier
                        - pushes characters, maybe objects?, to a side
                    - lightning storm
                        - creates lightning strikes randomly
                        - damages player and enemie
                    - rainy weather

                    - enemies in area do not respawn
                    - can have a boss enemy in the middle
                    - be able to modify enemies in this area
                    - be able to spawn different enemies
                    - be able to change map tile textures
                    - be able to set modifiers on circlular/rectangular map part
                    - be able to set modifiers on celestial direction map part
                    - what does the player gain doing it?

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - north: becomes snowy (each new run? each time king killed?)
                - icy ground, more difficult to move
            - east: becomes rainy
                - 
            - west: becomes dark
                - more difficult to see, fog of war. Blocking tiles block view
            - south: becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
