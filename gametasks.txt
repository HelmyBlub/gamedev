current tasks:
- problem: mouse hard too see sometimes
    - option to paint bigger mouse, or some sprite at mouse position

next feature ideas:
- maybe:

    - enemy collision / prevent enemy stacking
- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation

- WebGPU
    - can no do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system
