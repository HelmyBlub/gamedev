next test run:
increase version

current tasks:
- bug: short king recording not always resulting in working replay
    - next idea: check code from setting and saving random seed for starting replay to restarting game
        - maybe i save seed incorrectly in some cases?
    - could be a cause for multiplayer breaking
    - only replay which consistenly fails
    - some combination of classes required?
    - randomSeed is of by some low(2, 3, 5) value indicating something is generating randomNumbers inconsistently on game init
        - always incorrect randomNumber from gamestart
    - could not be reproduced with same steps
- think about one more curse
- be able to cleanse bad part of curses
- damagemeter/combatlog for curses?

next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - mapModifier:
        - "poison tiles" change walked over tiles to poison tiles which do % damage over time?
            - destroys ice tiles
            - ability for all enemies in this area, or the closer to the middle the more enemies have the ability
            - area boss ideas:
                - poison plant
                - plant shrinks the more poison it spreads
                - regenerates poison over time
                - can not be damaged
                - can not move? maybe blink?
                - defeated if survided long enough 
                - player has to trigger poison usage to shrink it faster than i can regenerate
        - wind modifier
            - pushes characters, maybe objects?, to a side
        - rainy weather

    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - becomes rainy
                - 
            - becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
