current tasks:
- first permanent progression idea:
    - dev steps:
        - working on characterClass upgrades for move speed and bonus hp for class building and legendary
        - what to do with hp and move speed upgrades? should not be lost. 
        - maybe bigger code redesign for later class ideas?
            - character upgrades?
                - dev:
                    - apply passive
                    - abilityRefId
                    - characterClass
                    - some info like hp amount

                - 50% dmg reduction (ball)
                - +hp (ball upgrade), Tower builder
                - +move speed Tower Builder
        - change scalling of burrowed abilities
            - ...
        - save in localStorage
        - visualize
        - if character with legendary sniper becomes endboss, "legendary snipe" not available in "smith building" until end boss defeated
            - "legendary sniper" becomes stronger somehow
- "paintCharacterStatsUI" fix UI text based on class and legendary
- check bug?: replay -> overtake -> past character from replay -> intended?
- rename endboss to king in code ?

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
