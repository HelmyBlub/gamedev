current tasks:
- background for takeover text. Hard to read when mutliple paint effects
- having multiple ball abilities? does not work
    - merge 2 past character abilities to increase strength?
        - but what if i take ball ability?
            - disable class choice
    - prevent taking multiple ball classes
        - same for builder

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
