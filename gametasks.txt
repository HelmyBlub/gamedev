current tasks:

    - check: lightning scaling mana cost: 1 target one mana, 2 targets 1.5 mana?
    - spelltype: charge
        - slows down movement
        - can charge as long as player want
        - spell gets stronger the longer the charging
        - button down, charge start, button up charge end
        - should be more mana efficient than instant or auto
    - hope explosion spell possible in the end: gets more expensive but explosion can get bigger and bigger

        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
