new test runs required: tamer, sniper,

current tasks:
- bug: missing leashes for tamer bosses? only in multiplayer?
- class Buildings and legendary:
    - dev steps:
        - bug: legendary class not displayed in highscore
        - visualize
            - display stats in info view
            - visualize abilities in classBuilding
        - change scalling of burrowed abilities
            - ...
        - if character with legendary sniper becomes endboss, "legendary snipe" not available in "smith building" until end boss defeated
            - "legendary sniper" becomes stronger somehow
- "paintCharacterStatsUI" fix UI text based on class and legendary
- check bug?: replay -> overtake -> past character from replay -> intended?
- rename endboss to king in code ?

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
