        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - north: becomes snowy (each new run? each time king killed?)
                - icy ground, more difficult to move
