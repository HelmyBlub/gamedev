current tasks:

- normal bosses abilities based on current end boss
    - a lot of problems if i just randomly take an ability for boss
        - sniper just always only simple snipe
        - tamer does not have feed/love abilities
        - works good for default
        - builder boss just gets more HP, but no changes in abilities
        - idea:
            - each player class has a create boss funktion.
                - easier to balance raising difficulty

- need new sniper boss kill testrun
- need new tamer boss kill testrun
- need new builder boss kill testrun


- balancing:
    - sniper boss too easy currently. Idea: randomize shoot position a bit

- End Bosses?
    - each celestial directions has its own boss

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
1. improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
