current tasks:
- new class:
    - impl:
        - ability lightning ball
            - try out different ideas. Currently it does not feel right
        - bounce ball upgrades
            - think about more "interesting" upgrades
- enemy on death put back to spawn position. So they tick in own chunk        

refactor possibilities:
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
