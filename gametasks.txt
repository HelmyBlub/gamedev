current tasks:
- first permanent progression idea:
    - make class building appear once a class endboss has been beaten or when endboss with a class has been beaten?
        - add building to map
            - just like sign
            - have x places like the logs where buildings can be.
        - has text "defeat class endboss to unlock legendary class"
    - "legendary class", can level indefinetly(but slower) over multiple runs (but boss skillpoints are limited to boss counter)
        - unlocking legendary "snipe": 
            - beat sniper endboss
                - give sniper weapon the lore "former weapon of king of the <celestialDirection>"
            - with new character take up "legendary class" from class building. Counts as class choose choice
                - but can take up multiple legendary classes at once
        - weapon returns to class building after each run unless character becomes new endboss
            - character becomes classless pastCharacter
            - if character with legendary sniper becomes endboss, "legendary snipe" not available in "smith building" until end boss defeated
                - "legendary sniper" becomes stronger somehow

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
