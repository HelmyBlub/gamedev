next test run: sniper, tamer, builder, ball, musician
increase version

current tasks:      
- improve path finding performance
    - investigate miltiplayer desync still happening?
    - multiplayer desync happened. On one screen dead. On the other not
        - hp different.
            - assumed reason: 
                - order of chunk path creating different.
                -> Results in different order for pathfinding
                -> results in different choice of enemies for pathing
            - maybe fixed by: addition to "case "sendGameState":" in "commands.ts"
    - check multiplayer will not desync
        - loading state should be borken? as i do not generate pathing data on state load
        - create pathing for every chunk on state load. could take a lot of time?
        - create pathing for active chunks
            - some performance loss for checking if data exists
            - 
    - check pathing on tile changes.
- bug: replay stuck on retry



next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding performance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - becomes rainy
                - 
            - becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
