next test run: tamer
increase version

current tasks:
- check for bugs, because replays failed:
    - sniper vs musician king + big enemies
        - replay not the same as record play. But replay consistently fails the same way
        - could reproduce 3xtimes in 5 tries, but takes longer run?
        - random number seed beginns being different mid game. All number generations where done by muscian ability when it started to be different
        - assumption: 
            - has to do with big enemies and order of creation?
            - order of enmies creating different
                ->  Results in enemies with swapped abilities
                ->  Results in aggroed enemies having different abilities
                ->  Results in different amount of random numbers generated.
            - verify musician enemies use random seed on generation? what is with ball enemies?
                - they do
            - why should chunk generation differ between normal run and replay?
            - checked replay/record stuff, but nothing special mid run. Only start and end happens alot.
            - chunk seems unlikely but i do not have any other idea
        - verify what could cause differences in code behaviour between record and replay stuff?
    - musician vs ball king + big enemies
- mapModifier: poison   
    - check balance
- balance check: damage over time for musician king


- be able to cleanse bad part of curses
- damagemeter/combatlog for curses?
- think about changing alot of type casts as they are not required
    - "ability as AbilitySomething" could be replaced by giving the type to function property directly
    - type | undefined change to ?

next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - mapModifier:
        - "poison tiles" change walked over tiles to poison tiles which do % damage over time?
            - destroys ice tiles
            - ability for all enemies in this area, or the closer to the middle the more enemies have the ability
            - area boss ideas:
                - poison plant
                - plant shrinks the more poison it spreads
                - regenerates poison over time
                - can not be damaged
                - can not move? maybe blink?
                - defeated if survided long enough 
                - player has to trigger poison usage to shrink it faster than it can regenerate
        - wind modifier
            - pushes characters, maybe objects?, to a side
        - rainy weather

    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - becomes rainy
                - 
            - becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
