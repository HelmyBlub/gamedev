                - 
            - more to explore on map, currently most is the same
                - manipulate certain part of map with modifier

                    - be able to change map tile textures
                    - what does the player gain doing it?

- think about next bigger feature

        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?

        - random weather effects
        - more variation
