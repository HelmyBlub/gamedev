current tasks:
- some balancing:
    - adding ability unleash pet for tamer
- performance when playing long time: on reload the entire map enemies get regenerated, change to only when player reaches it again
- Bug: pet leashes on past characters gone?


refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
