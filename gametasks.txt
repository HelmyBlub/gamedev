increase version

current tasks:
- mapModifier: poison   
    - check balance
        - hard to get and not that strong
    - hard to see hp bar

- be able to cleanse bad part of curses
    - on 80_000 distance make a new closed of area with some fountain
    - fountain is an interactable which asks: clean curses form legendary?
    - when started for each curse currently on player legendary create a more difficult challenge
        - ideas:
            - poison curse ->change tiles to poison tiles in area
            - darkness -> limit view distance, create clones
            - ice curse -> change tiles to ice tiles in area
            - lightning -> lightning strikes while fighting
            - what type of boss?
    - when challenge survived
        - poison curse cleanse -> immun to poison tile damage
        - darkness curse cleanse -> clones no longer turn evil
        - ice curse -> no longer affected by ice tile sliding
        - lightning curse -> immune to lightning strike  damage
- damagemeter/combatlog for curses?

next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - becomes rainy
                - 
            - becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
