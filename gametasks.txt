current tasks:
- ability lightningStirkes 
    - add as upgrade to lightning ball
- new class:
    - impl:
        - ability lightning ball
            - upgrades:
                - random bonus stat upgrade: +bounceSpeed,+angle,+speedLoss,+maxSpeed, -rechargeTime, +charges
                - lighning buff
                    - grows stronger with distance?
                    - damages nearby enemies in intervals
                - lightning debuff
                    - enemy takes more damage, speed up bounce ball, stackable
        - bounce ball
            - think about more "interesting" upgrades
                - each bounce increases damage
                - temporary buff enemies hit burn, runs for some time after bounce ball finishes
                - random bonus stat upgrade: +bounceSpeed,+angle,+speedLoss,+maxSpeed, -rechargeTime, +charges
                - debuff
                    - enemy takes more damage, colldown reduce for lightning ball

- enemy on death put back to spawn position. So they tick in own chunk
- having multiple ball abilities? does not work

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
