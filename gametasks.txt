next test run: 
increase version

current tasks:     
- new class spellmaker
    - bug: fire lines ticks forever
    - spellcast creates seeker projectile which seeks enemy and explodes on contact, can define start fly direction of each single one
        - need "proximitySensor" + seeker attachment and "stage 2" which triggers on enemy hit with explosion
            - design "stage"
                - buttons to switch through stages
                    - display some text on button to know what it does
                - continue: paint only stage relevant stuff
                - attach second stage to proximity
                - mana cost calc
    - somehow make arbitrary spells and be able to cast them repeatedly
        - can influence size    (brush size)
        - can influence shape   (paint)
        - can influence effect  (color)
        - player has mana: paint amount limited
            - amount of paint used for a spell determines mana usage
        - black color Damage:
            - when painting closed shape => will do aoe damage with this shape
            - when painting line => will shot projectile
    - remember: relative mouse position not used for holding mouse button down
    - hope explosion spell possible in the end: gets more expensive but explosion can get bigger and bigger
- speedrun my game
    - kill god as fast as possible
        - real Time: <12:07 (builder + ball)
        - real time: <18:20 (builder + tamer)
        - to squishy (builder + sniper)
    - kill hard mode god as fast as possible:
        - strategy:
            - ball to end for money and upgrade buildings
            - play sniper and become king
                - defeat king for legendary, use ball + legendary to defeat all kings to level up
            - sniper legendary
                - level up max (~40min skillpoints 25 and level 430)
                    - still to weak and very laggy build
- bug: short king replay failed. why?
    - very first pet movement of past characters seems correct, second broken


next feature ideas:
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extend existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
        - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
            - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - more classes
        - spellmaker
            - be able to make spells by drawing
    - base building
        - more options to spend money to build up map center city
    - money gambling casino
    - make random caves/dungeon to enter
        - try out different generation stategies
