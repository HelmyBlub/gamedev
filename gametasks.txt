next test run:  tamer, musician
increase version

current tasks:      
- test runs
- thinking about what is next
    - different strategies per class should be viable (being able to defeat initial kings)
        - try around, each class should have different options to achieve it
            - tamer
                - tamer pets can all have same abilities?
                - new range pet abilities   
                    - single target/ medium range
                        - small pet. faster but less damage
                        - big pet. more damage but moves less. so might not keep up with enemy
                        - throws boomerang type of weapong. Comes back. targeted on one enemy but hits everything in its path
                    - multi target
                        - firing range targeted explosives
                        - bigger pet, less frequent shooting, bigger explosion (good aoe)
                        - smaller pet, more shooting, smaller explosions (good single target)

    - more upgrade choices
        - think about new tamer pet ability

next feature ideas:
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation
    - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
        - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety        
        - common, rare, epic, legendary
    - base building
        - more options to spend money to build up map center city
    - more classes
    - graphics:
        - random weather effects
        - more variation 
            - becomes rainy
                - 
            - becomes desert
                - nothing special

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
