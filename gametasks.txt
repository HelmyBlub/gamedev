current tasks:
- bug: class building burrowed text destoryed by replay
- bug: pet not teleporting into king area
- bug: not spending boss skill point on legendary and defeating 2 level 1 bosses gives second skill point
- problem: to many abilties no longer visible with "tab"/info key. Improve it
- change tamer: pets should teleport back instead of getting lost.
    - if pets sad, should run towards player
    - reduce care amount required
- test counter for maximum damage number on screen
- king tower builder with too many slow towers hard to see
- play the game to check for bugs / problems
- think about next bigger feature 
    - ideas
        - some easier permanent progression. like more baseHP, more baseSpeed gain for each run

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
