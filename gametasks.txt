current tasks:
- new class:
    - mouseUpdate currenlty happening constantly. Needs to be able to determine when active and not even when snipe and bounce ball are together
    - ball bounce method redesign?: remove recursion?
    - impl:
        - create new character
            - creates ball abilities and puts them on character
            - check if overwrite movement possible
                - should also work for normal characters in the end
                - so overwrite should not be class dependant
            - should change movement based on buffs
        - create ability bounce ball
            - create a new buff:
                - give player a buff which changes movement behaviour, one buff type for all ball movement changes
        - create ability lightning ball
            - create a new buff:
                - give player a buff which changes movement behaviour, one buff type for all ball movement changes
    - Ball
        - first ideas: 
            - ability to become a ball moving forward. ball immune to damage.
                does damage to hit enemies. Ball rolls forward,
                direction can be slightly influence by mouse.
                ball loses speed over time. once speed dropts to 0 ball mode ends.
                ball ganes speed by bouncing of wall
        - second idea:
            - lightning ball
                - ability to become a ball. Jumping from enemy to close enemy as long as enemy
                in direction of mouse and close to it exists. Each jump does damage.
        - do both ideas
        


possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
