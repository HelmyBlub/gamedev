next test run: Sniper, All

current tasks:
- bug: deafeat king, than reload browser, missing building?
- bug: unhappy pet should not use ability
- check: statsUIs after gameEnd and with legendaries

- think about next bigger feature 
    - ideas
        - some easier permanent progression. like more baseHP, more baseSpeed gain for each run

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
