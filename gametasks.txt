next functional tasks:
- change enemy spawn and behaviour 
    - enemy has 
        - spawn position
        - respawn time
        - auto aggro range, range to the player at which the enemy automatically beginns running to the player
        - max aggro range, range to the player at which an enemey stops following
    - spawn enemies "everywhere"
    - enemies only run to player ones hit or ones the player is close enough
        - enemies stop following beeing to far away from player
    - enemies are stronger the further away from the middle they where spawned
        - depending on the direction they can be stronger in different ways
    - enemies can respawn, but not close to the player
    - spawn area does not spawn enemies
- how to spawn enemies?
    - 

next technical tasks or bugs:
- find uses of "any" type and try to remove
- upgrade versions
- use same code files for backend and frontend
    - understand require vs import in backend vs frontend
- holding key down creates a lot of keyDown events, always sending over network although nothing changed

future functional tasks:
    - map tiles:
        - destroyable tiles
            - destroy trees to gather wood
    - improve enemies?
        - sprites/ images
        - less enemies but some behaviour patterns?
        - can use abilities?
    - playerCharacters
        - different playstyles
        - more different upgradeOptions
        - sprites/images for player
    - procedural map generation
        - add more map features for orientation like a path
        - unity example https://gamedevacademy.org/procedural-2d-maps-unity-tutorial/
    - multiplayer 
        - gamesync
            - try with different client delays
            - need real users to compare how it behaves
    - every one controlls their own character
        - currently has to wait on gamerestart, could make it to be in on join

    - make the game look descent as soon as it fun
    - deployment pipeline to a real server
    - projectiles hitting same enemy every tick

future technical tasks:
- multiplayer connection delay with localtunnel is too bad, try other options?
- think: is automated testing already usefull?
- https/ssl websocket
    - https://www.nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/, where goes the config?
