text test run: Tamer, Builder, Sniper, All

current tasks:
- bug: unhappy pet should not use ability
- problem: to many abilties. no longer visible with "tab"/info key. Improve it
    - limit number of displayed abilities
        - only display for one character class
        - put in button to change which class is displayed
        - put in button to switch if e.g. class building or player is displayed
    - dev steps:
        - StatsUIsPartContainer can have StatsUIsPartContainers[]
            - each character class has its own container
            - first paint heading and make them selectable
            - paint main container StatsUIsPart 
            - then paint child containers StatsUIsPart 

- think about next bigger feature 
    - ideas
        - some easier permanent progression. like more baseHP, more baseSpeed gain for each run

refactor possibilities:
- ability creation: checks and scales for bosses, enemy or player by itself
- paint UI charges (reduce code duplication)
- createAbilityBossUpgradeOptions (reduce code duplciation)

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
