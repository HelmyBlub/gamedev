next test run: 
increase version

current tasks:     
- new class spellmaker
    - try change: spellcast center to made objects not to player for charge and instant casts
        - auto cast based on player
        - player orbit based on player
        - enemy based on character position
        - continue: bug: orbiter can be locked to player, than it should not be moved
    - spelltype: charge
        - balancing:
            - should be more mana efficient than instant or auto when charging for longer,
                - when doing instant should be weaker but same mana efficiency
        - problem: i did not want to use it? mathematically it has just the same strength
    - hope explosion spell possible in the end: gets more expensive but explosion can get bigger and bigger

    - remember: relative mouse position not used for holding mouse button down
    - achievements
    - test run
    - check "playerGlobalAlphaMultiplier" to be used in spellmaker
    - check: touch controlls for spellmake mode

    - kill hard mode god as fast as possible:
        - strategy:

            - play sniper and become king
                - defeat king for legendary, use ball + legendary to defeat all kings to level up
            - sniper legendary
                - level up max (~40min skillpoints 25 and level 430)
                    - still to weak and very laggy build
- bug: short king replay failed. why?
    - very first pet movement of past characters seems correct, second broken


next feature ideas:
- each stream spend time on thinking whats next
    - what makes most sense to work on?
        - what would make the game more fun to play for me?
            - finding out how to min/max something?
                - difficult to create when i am the one developing it

- think about next bigger feature

        - unlock more upgrade choices. Don't overwhelm player at start, but give choice for future
            - with money?
        - over achievements?
    - randomize upgarde with rariety
