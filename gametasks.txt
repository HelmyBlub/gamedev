next test run: 
increase version

current tasks:
- enemy collision / prevent enemy stacking
    - currently deactivate in "tickMapCharacters"
    - not performant enough yet    
        - only check chunks adjacent to players?
- test replay allShortKing

next feature ideas:
- maybe:
    - improve path finding perfromance
- think about next bigger feature 
    - extends existings classes for more upgrade choice?
        - more run variation

interests me:
- WebGPU
    - can not do it with my Virtual Machine setup
        - GPU not available in VM. I only have one for host operating system


refactor possibilities:

possible future tasks: (only keep 5)
- improvement: getChunksTouchingLine2 does not work, still needs to improve
